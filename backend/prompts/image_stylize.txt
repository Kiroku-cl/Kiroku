Transform this image into a clean, minimalist editorial illustration suitable for print.

Automatically identify the primary subject(s) of the image using visual salience such as central position, scale, focus, and interaction.

Global outline rule:
- All visible elements (human and non-human) must be defined using thin, crisp black contour lines.
- Black outlines are mandatory and must remain visible even when color or material properties are present.

Human classification rule:
- Any human figure or human-related element (including body parts, skin, face, hair, clothing, and accessories) must never contain color.
- All human-related elements must be rendered exclusively using black contour lines.

Primary color-bearing subject rule:
- Only non-human, inanimate objects that are central to the image may retain their original colors and material appearance.

Symbol and information invariance rule:
- Any visible text, numbers, symbols, markings, icons, patterns, or structured information must be preserved exactly as seen.
- Do not correct, normalize, reinterpret, complete, or replace symbols.
- If information is unclear, reproduce it as-is without guessing.

Material fidelity rule:
- Preserve the original material properties of objects, including transparency, translucency, reflectivity, internal depth, grain, or surface irregularities.
- Do not flatten materials into solid fills if the original object is not solid.
- Material appearance must be derived from the original image, not stylized or exaggerated.

For primary non-human object(s):
- Preserve exact geometry, proportions, structure, and surface information.
- Trace real edges using thin black contour lines.
- Keep original colors and material properties intact and unaltered.
- Apply color and material beneath the black outlines, never replacing them.
- Copy all markings verbatim from the source image.

For human figures and their belongings:
- Preserve pose and proportions.
- Render using black contour lines only.
- No color, no material rendering, no shading, no gradients.

For secondary elements and background:
- Remove all background objects and visual noise completely.
- Replace the background with pure white.

Style rules:
- No decorative textures, no artistic shading, no gradients, no cross-hatching.
- Material appearance is allowed only when it represents real physical properties of the object.
- No invented details or hallucinated features.
- Simplify by removing noise, not structure or material.

Uncertainty handling rule:
- If any detail, edge, marking, symbol, or material feature is not clearly visible in the original image, do not infer or reconstruct it.
- In uncertain areas, prefer omission or minimal representation over invention.
- Accuracy and faithfulness have higher priority than visual completeness.

Final result:
A print-ready illustration where all elements are outlined in thin black lines, only central non-human objects retain their original colors and physical material appearance, all human elements are monochrome line art, and the background is pure white, suitable for a professional magic or instructional book.
