Convert this image into a clean, minimalist line drawing. Use only black contour lines on a pure white background. Keep the main subjects and their poses but simplify to essential outlines only. Ignore any objects in the background and just focus on the main subject of the picture. No shading, no colors, no gradients - just crisp thin black lines on white. Style: simple sketch, like a coloring book page.
